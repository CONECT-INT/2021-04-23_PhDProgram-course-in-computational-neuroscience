# Computational Neuroscience Tutorial 2021

Learning topic: introductionary elements to run a Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) by using PyNN on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system.

## Content:

### SNNs design (Main notebook [CNS tutorial](CNS_tutorial.ipynb)
1. neurons
    - cell types
    - populations
    - recording variables
1. connections
    - synapse types
    - connections types
    - projections

### network examples
- [1D small network](eg_1D_small-network.ipynb)
- [1D decaying network](eg_1D_decaying-network.ipynb)
- [1D persistent network](eg_1D_persistent-network.ipynb)
- [1D diverging network](eg_1D_diverging-network.ipynb)
-     
### topics for an advanced class (aka, what there's not in this tutorial)
- bio-realistic neural network 
- large scale computation
- model replicaton (i.e., reproduce results from paper)
- parameters explorations

### expected take-home-points: 
- import the simulator
- setup the simulator
- decide the cell types 
- design the populations
- define the synapse types
- select the connection algorithm
- make the projections 
- idealize the stimulus
- run the simulation
- save the results
- close the simulations
- recover the result
- postprocessing (visualization, statistics, etc)
