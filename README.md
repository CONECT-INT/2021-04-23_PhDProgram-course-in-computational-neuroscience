# Computational Neuroscience Tutorial 2021

Learning topic: introductionary elements to run a Spiking Neural Network by using PyNN on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic system.

# Content:

## network building and running
1. neurons
    - cell types
    - populations
    - recording variables
1. connections
    - synapse types
    - connections types
    - projections

## network examples
- examples of an entry level SNNs  
    
## topics for an advanced class (aka, what it's not in this tutorial)
- bio-realistic neural network 
- large scale computation
- model replicaton (i.e., reproduce results from paper)
- parameters explorations
